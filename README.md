# Install

1.This is a normal c++ plugin, if you do not familiar with how to add plugin to your project,
see [this video](https://youtu.be/DRtkq0ewTz4) to learn how to add c++ plugin to your project.

2.put your google-services.json file under the folder ProjectRoot/Build/Android

4.****important:  to use realtime database, you need first call FirebaseInitialize first in c++ or blueprint.

5.****important: if the engine version is 4.18, then you need open android sdk manager and update google repository,
because the engine did not include full firebase 11.0.4.


# Usage
  The best practice to learn how to use this plugin, is to read my demo project blueprint code. To test the project, you need to 
  package the project to android with distribution setting.
  To see this demo how to work, you can direct download the apk from [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsv5ajjgymzcl5n/UEFireBase-Android-Shipping-armv7-es2.apk?dl=0).
  
  ****Note:please do not use my google-services.json for your own product, you should create your own project on firebase console.
